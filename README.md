# pls

`pls` is a CLI program that uses AI to tell you the command you are needing to accomplish a certain task from your
terminal.
Additionally, you can use it to generate and modify text and images, given a text description.

Its name is a short form of "please". And careful â€” `pls` acts a little grumpy when asked out-of-scope questions.

You can read more about it in the [design document](docs/design_document.md).
