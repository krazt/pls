# pls

`pls` is a CLI program that uses AI (OpenAI's GPT-3.5) to tell you the command you need to run in your terminal,
given your description in natural language.
Also, it can run the command for you.

Its name is a short form of "please". And careful â€” `pls` acts a little grumpy when asked out-of-scope questions.

You can read more about it in the [design document](docs/design_document.md).
